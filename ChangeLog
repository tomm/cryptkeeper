	* src/main.cpp (update_mounted): Moved code common to
	sico_right_button_activated and sico_activated into a new
	function.

	*  Forked from <https://github.com/tomm/cryptkeeper>

	* ChangeLog: Added. This ChangeLog only keeps record of
	development done in this forked version.

	* src/lsof.cpp: Added missing #include<unistd.h>

	* src/main.cpp (on_exit): New feature: directories are
	automatically unmounted when quitting cryptkeeper.

	(sico_right_button_activated): The previous code only checked
	whether some mount point was or not mounted when activating the
	left-click menu. Of course, this disrupted the behavior of the new
	on_exit function, which is accessed from the right-click menu.

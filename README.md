# About

Cryptkeeper is a Linux system tray applet that manages EncFS encrypted folders.

To build from source you will need:

* libgtk+ >= 2.8
* gconf 2.0
* encfs and fuse (fuse 2.6.3 works)

On Ubuntu you can install EncFS like this:

```
sudo aptitude install encfs
sudo echo "fuse" >> /etc/modules
sudo modprobe fuse
sudo addgroup <your username> fuse
```

On Solus OS dependencies for building and running can be installed like this:

```
sudo eopkg install libgtk-2-devel gconf-devel encfs
```

Then you must log off and back on again.
